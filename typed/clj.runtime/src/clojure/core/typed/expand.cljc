;; TODO need a way to specify a custom expansion for the Gilardi scenario
;;      that's actually evaluated (ie. used instead of :original-form in eval-ast).
;; This would be used only in analyze+eval.
;; Rationale: we assume macroexpansion is idempotent and unordered, but (obviously) not evaluation.
;; To properly type check a top-level form, it much be evaluated using top-level
;; `do` rules, and so either:
;; - the type checking requires evaluation order of top-level `do`'s to be respected,
;;   and type checking fails, or
;;   - eg. custom expansion of (do (defmacro a ...) (a ...))
;; - :original-form will be out of date and subsequently evaluating it
;;    may involve repeated evaluation
;;   - unsure, but this scenario might be impossible.

;; Discussion:
;; we're at a fork in the road at how seriously we need to handle the Gilardi
;; scenario and interleaving macroexpansion and evaluation.
;; If we could simplify type checking to just involve macroexpansion (and
;; never needing to evaluate intermediate forms), things would be simpler.
;; We basically assume that macros and "compile-time" things are static,
;; which, IME, outside of clojure.core bootstrapping (eg., `clojure.core/defn`)
;; is actually a pretty good assumption.
;; Very early versions of Typed Clojure used to evaluate a file before type
;; checking it, and then type check each form using `analyze` to get the AST 
;; instead of `analyze+eval`. IIRC this worked well enough.
;; If we're going to do things like symbolic closures that cross top-level forms,
;; then it's very likely we're going to break the normal macroexpansion/evaluation
;; order (if, eg., reducing the symbolic closure involves macroexpansion, like
;; the following scenario):
;;  (defmacro i-change [] 1)
;;  (defn a [x] (i-change))
;;  (defmacro i-change [] 2)
;;  (defn b [y] (a 1))
;; I find it hard to believe that this happens often, because in almost any Clojure
;; file I've worked with, you can eval a form at any point in the file with no inconsistencies.
;; You can probably rearrange the order of any Clojure expression in the same "phase"
;; and it will mostly work.

;; If we strictly want to adhere to Clojure's evaluation order as we type check,
;; then non-compound top-level forms seem easy to deal with if we want to throw
;; away macro-expansion: just throw away the type checker's macroexpanded code
;; after type checking, and `eval` the originally non-compound top-level expression instead.
;; For compound top-level forms, the "real" and "fake" expansions need to coincide
;; at least in the number and order of their top-level children.
;; eg., (defmacro deftype [..] (do e1  e2  e3))  ;; actual expansion
;;      (defmacro deftype [..] (do e1' e2' e3')) ;; fake expansion
;; We then process each top-level subform in lockstep, evaluating the real expansion
;; before type checking the next one. ie.,
;; 1. type check e1'
;; 2. eval e1
;; 3. type check e2'
;; 4. eval e2
;; etc.
;; If any top-level expression is itself a compound top-level expression, it is also
;; processed with this assumption in mind.

;; However, as above, symbolic closures crossing top-level forms complicates this greatly,
;; I think irreparably. Think: you might need a symbolic closure from further down the
;; same file that you haven't evaluated yet, or even from another namespace that you processed
;; long ago. Even the simple case of using a symbolic closure from a top-level form you
;; just processed might break some assumptions.

;; Is Typed Clojure more a linter or a type system? Well, it's both, but I think
;; it's qualities as a linter are more in demand. Its greatest inheritance from the world of
;; type systems is the notion of soundness "up-to" specific assumptions.
;; I want to add a new assumption: rearranging the order of any forms in the same "stage" is equivalent
;; in any file Typed Clojure type checks. This is a common assumption as devs often copy-paste
;; and re-eval code in their REPL without carefully recreating the precise order of 
;; top-level forms before it. If we can assume it while type checking, it enables the
;; kinds of symbolic execution that I think is necessary to elide many top-level annotations
;; a la Flow lang.

;; The new strategy for type checking a file would be:
;; 1. re-load the file
;; 2. type-check each form in the file without evaluating the end results
;; I guess this also assumes that re-evaluating reader eval #= forms is ok.
;; Using these assumptios to their logical conclusion, we could parallelize
;; the type checking of individual forms.

;; Update: I found a discussion where Rich Hickey explicitly says macros should not have
;; side effects (that are relied on) 
;; - https://groups.google.com/d/msg/clojure/Ch4aaR_pTD0/Gpiqi4JJeK8J
;; (This was basically what I hypothesized in my dissertation, but I would have saved
;; a lot of space if I found this earlier!)

;; eg., perhaps a flag that designates an expansion "safe" for top-level usage.
;; Note: this isn't atomic with the other multimethods, consider single stateful reference
